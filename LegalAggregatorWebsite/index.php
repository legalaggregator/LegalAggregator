<p>Legal Aggregator uses publicly available information published by law firms and organizations working with them, such as industry associations, staffing firms, and others. Using these data enables us to uncover trends in the law firm hiring practices and business strategies. At this point we are still working on expanding our coverage to include all of the top law firms.</p>

  Our framework makes it easiest for us to onboard listings powered by viDesktop, Jobvite, and Silkroad. We can also onboard other, custom listings using our custom parser and scraper. In technical terms, we can easily parse any listing where individual records and fields have their own designated CSS classes.
